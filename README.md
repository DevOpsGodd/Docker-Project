# Deploying a Laravel App Using Docker

### Objective 
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Laravel application using Docker. 

### Introduction
Docker is a platform that allows you to easily build, test, and deploy applications as containers. Containers are lightweight, stand-alone, and portable executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Laravel and Docker

### Deployment steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/Uthycloud/Docker-Project.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd Docker-project

```

3. Build the docker image
```
docker build -t laravel-app .

```

4. Run a container from the Docker image.
5. Access the Laravel application in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8000`.

### Conclusion
In this project, you have learned how to deploy a Laravel application using Docker. Docker is a powerful tool that allows you to easily deploy applications in a consistent and repeatable way. By using containers, you can ensure that your application runs in the same environment everywhere, which is essential for developing and testing applications in a production-like environment.
